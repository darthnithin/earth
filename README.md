# Parler Map
Github pages no longer works as I revoked my Google Maps API Key. If you want it, you have to replace it with you own, along with a map id.
## Setup

```sh
npm i
npm run dev  # development
npm run build  # production
```

The application is currently using the `.env` file to embed the API key in the
HTML document. This is a temporary key and is not valid for production usage. It
can be replaced by following these instructions to
[get an api key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
